## Overview of the School District Analysis
The school district would like to investigate academic dishonest at schools throughout the district. They would like to narrow their focus on Thomas High School; however, it is not limited to just this High School. he district has been altered that the grades for 9th grade students at Thomas High Schools were compromised by altercation. During our analysis we replaced the reading and math schores for these students. To handle their rest of the request, the goal was to analyze data from various testing results. These tests were based on reading and math scores from 15 high schools for 9th thorugh 12th grades.  

## Results

We removed the 9th Grade Scores from our data. Taking the 9th grade data from THS out of the scope did not have a great effect on the school districts averages grades. ![Image 1 ](https://github.com/LindsayTeeters/Week_4/blob/main/Resources/Deliverable%201-%20LOC%20replace%20ninth%20graders%20grade%20with%20NaN.png)

# School Summary with Budget

Looking at the schools from a budget standpoint, the Thomas High School (THS) is slightly higher than the average budget per student of these shcools. THS is averaging $638 per student while the district average is $620.
  - A couple of the other schools with higher budgets per students do not necessarily have a better passing percentage. This may mean that their is no correlation between grades and budget. Which most likely means, if grades were altered, it was students and not faculty members.

## Summary
